üõ†Ô∏è Advanced SolidWorks Design Studies & Portfolio

This repository serves as a meticulously organized digital portfolio and reference library for my daily advanced design practice using SolidWorks.

It contains a collection of complex part models, advanced assemblies, motion studies, and detailed drawings created to demonstrate proficiency in professional mechanical design workflows, parametric modeling, and industry best practices.

üöÄ Repository Goals

The core objectives of this repository are centered on professional growth and skill validation:

Skill Demonstration: To showcase proven capability in areas like complex surfacing, sheet metal design, weldments, and large assembly management for potential employers and colleagues.

Future Reference: To maintain a version-controlled library of challenging projects, custom features, and design methodologies for quick reference.

Continuous Learning: To track daily progress and iterative improvements in CAD efficiency and design optimization.
