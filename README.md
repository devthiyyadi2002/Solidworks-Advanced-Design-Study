üõ†Ô∏è Advanced SolidWorks Design Studies & Portfolio  

This repository serves as a meticulously organized digital portfolio and reference library for my daily advanced design practice using SolidWorks.

It contains a collection of complex part models, advanced assemblies, motion studies, and detailed drawings created to demonstrate proficiency in professional mechanical design workflows, parametric modeling, and industry best practices.

üöÄ Repository Goals

Skill Demonstration: Showcase proven capability in complex surfacing, sheet metal design, weldments, and large assembly management for potential employers.

Future Reference: Maintain a version-controlled library of challenging projects, custom features, and design methodologies.

Continuous Learning: Track daily progress and iterative improvements in CAD efficiency and design optimization.
